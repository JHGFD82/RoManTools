# Command-line Execution
A properly formed command will include the following:

1. The initial execution instruction
2. The command to be executed, e.g. `convert` for romanization conversion, `validator` for validation of romanized Mandarin
3. Required arguments based on which command is being executed
4. Optional parameters for additional features
5. Optional parameters for debugging purposes

## Example
A test command you can run that verifies a proper installation is:

`python main.py convert --input "Bai Juyi" --convert_from py --convert_to wg`

This command will result in the printed result:

`Pai Ch√ºi`

All options are described below.

## 1. Initial Execution Instruction
RoManTools can be executed from the command line by first navigating to the location where you have downloaded RoManTools and running the following command inside the `src` folder:

`python main.py`

Or on systems with installations of both Python 2 and 3:

`python3 main.py`

You will receive an error since required arguments are not being supplied, however this will verify that you executed the command in the correct location. 

## 2. Commands
`convert` Support for converting between Pinyin and Wade-Giles (with Yale and additional standards to be added in future versions).

`cherry_pick` Converts only identified romanized Chinese terms, excluding any English words or those in a stopword list.

`segment` Segments text into meaningful chunks, a feature that will be utilized by other actions and also available for direct use by the user.

`syllable_count` Counts the number of syllables per word and provides a report to the user.

`detect_method` Identifies the romanization standard used in the input text and returns the detected standard(s) to the user as either a single standard or a list of multiple standards.

`validator` Basic validation of supplied text.

## 3. Required Arguments
### Note: "methods" refers to currently supported romanization methods:
- Pinyin (entered as `py` or `pinyin`)
- Wade-Giles (entered as `wg` or `wage-giles`)

`-i / --input` The text to be analyzed/converted.

`-m / --method` The romanization method of the supplied text.

`-f / --convert_from` The originating romanization method to be analyzed.

`-t / --convert_to` The method to which the text is being converted.

## 4. Optional Parameters for Additional Features
`-w / --per_word` For supported actions, return results of analysis on a per-word basis. Performing an action without this parameter will result in a single response.

### Examples

#### Detect Method

- `python main.py detect_method -i "Bai Juyi"` returns `py`
- `python main.py detect_method -i "Bai Juyi" --per_word` returns `[{'word': 'Bai', 'methods': ['py']}, {'word': 'Juyi', 'methods': ['py', 'wg']}]`
- 
#### Validator

- `python main.py validator -i "Bai Julyi` returns `False`
- `python main.py validator -i "Bai Julyi --per_word` returns `[{'word': 'bai', 'syllables': ['bai'], 'valid': [True]}, {'word': 'julyi', 'syllables': ['ju', 'lyi'], 'valid': [True, False]}]`

## 5. Optional Parameters for Debugging Purposes*
### *Note: Currently, no parameters currently function. This section is for the purpose of detailing features from a future release.

`-C / --crumbs` Reports a breadcrumb trail from the analysis process.
### Example
`python main.py validator -i "Bai Julyi -wC`

`### Analyzing Bai Julyi ###`
`# Processing Bai`
`# Initial: B`
`# Final: ai`
`# Valid: True`
